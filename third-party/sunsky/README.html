	A Practical Analytic Model for Daylight</a></h3>


<p>
      The files in this directory are a rewrite of the code used in
      the paper.  The results from the code seem to match that from
      the original.  There are classes referenced in the code that are 
      not included in this directory.  Some documentation (but not source
      code) for those classes <a href="/~bes/graphics/pris.html"> is
	available. </a>  For the most part, the unavailable classes do 
      pretty much what you would expect them to do.  The code here may 
      change somewhat over time.  The atmospheric perspective code had 
      a faster rewrite and less error checking than the rest.
</p>

<p>
      <em class=warning>All standard disclaimers and limits on
	liability apply.  There is no guarantee the code works and
	there is no guarantee that it is equivalent to the code used
	in the paper.</em>
